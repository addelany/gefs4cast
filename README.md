Cloud-native access and downloading of NOAA's GEFS data. **Caution** package is highly experimental and not yet suitable for general use.  Direct access to EFI-processed GEFS forecasts for NEON sites may be available through the [`neon4cast` package](https://github.com/eco4cast/neon4cast).

Example scripts can be seen in the `inst/examples` directory.
